Forage App
==================================

Forage app allows users to keep track of items, food for example, that they've foraged for in nature. This data is persisted between sessions using Room. You can read, write update and delete data in the App. 
It's a working app you can simply download it and run it on your IDE, More Info about this project will be added shortly. Thanks :D
